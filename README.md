# RPS HTML

Our goal in this project is to learn the very basics of HTML, in order to prepare us to scrape the web.

Ultimately, we want to end up with a directory of members of our team.

## Tasks

 - Clone this repository (don't fork first).
 - Create a uniquely named branch for your profile page, e.g. `raghu-b`.
 - In your editor of choice (I recommend VSCode), create a file for your page ending with `.html`, e.g. `raghu-b.html`.
 - Add the following code to the file (with your name instead):

    ```html
    <h1>Your Name</h1>
    ```

 - Open the file in your browser of choice (I recommend Chrome).
 - You can go on to write some copy in the file:
   - Where and what did you study?
   - What is your area of interest?
   - Which PI are you working with?
   - Where are you from?
   - How long have you been in Chicago?
   - Is there any spot in Chicago you've been meaning to check out?
